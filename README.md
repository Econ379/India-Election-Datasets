NOTE: IF you need any datafiles or code before I will upload them in March to April do not hesitate to write me a mail (magnusraab(at)outlook.de) I will respond to you immediately.

This repository is for the collected datasets for future MSc students as well as anyone who stumpled over it.  It has the collected PMGSY data on district level from 2000-2024, Affidavits Data from 2004-2024, as well as the code to webscrape the data yourself.

This Cleaned is saved as .xlsx solely for compression reasons. This may cause issues when reading the content. Therefore, it may be easiest to open the file in Excel, resave it as .csv, and then open it using your preferred statistical software. Also please be adware that this "cleaned" version removed all Districts that changed upto 2022. For a full dataset please refer to RAW-Datafiles, and just remove the part of my R code that removes all changed Districts.
